David Allsopp has previously contributed patches for native Windows support to Merlin, and after the release of [Merlin 3.0.0](http://opam.ocaml.org/packages/merlin/merlin.3.0.0/) back in July, he's been working with Frédéric Bour to port the new features to Windows.

[This post](http://www.dra27.uk/blog/platform/2017/08/24/merlin-3-on-windows.html) from David explores some of the challenges for cross-platform development between Windows and Unix systems.

Richard Mortier recently decided to refresh and update his [ocal](https://github.com/mor1/ocal/) command-line calendaring package, and took the opportunity to use the new packaging and build features present in [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/): [topkg](https://github.com/dbuenzli/topkg) and [jbuilder](https://github.com/janestreet/jbuilder).

[This post](http://mort.io/blog/2017/08/28/past-present-future/) from Mort details the process of removing remnants of older features such as [Oasis](https://github.com/ocaml/oasis), creating new jbuild files and topkg skeletons, and finally preparing and publishing a release into opam.

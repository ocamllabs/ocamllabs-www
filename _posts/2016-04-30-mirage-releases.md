April was a busy month and saw two new [MirageOS](/wiki/MirageOS "wikilink")
releases: 2.8 on April 6th, and 2.9 on April 29th.

-   [Mirage 2.9](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/mirage/mirage.2.9.0/)
    focussed on the tooling around logging, and built on work started at
    the MirageOS Hackathon. 2.9 includes the mirage command-line tool
    that allows log reporters to be configured at configuration and
    runtime, and the ability to disable command-line parsing at runtime.

-   [Mirage 2.8](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/mirage/mirage.2.8.0/)
    was [Mindy](https://github.com/yomimono)'s first release and it went
    without a hitch! It was released alongside TCP/IP 2.8.0 and was a
    small changeset affecting the STACKV4 module type.

The annual [ICFP](http://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-2016) conference
begins today, with the initial workshops kicking off [100s of
talks](http://conf.researchr.org/program/icfp-2016/program-icfp-2016)
and [paper presentations](https://github.com/gasche/icfp2016-papers),
including [several from OCaml
Labs](https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AEssential).

We've created a liveblog unikernel to keep track of the proceedings, at
**[icfp2016.mirage.io](http://icfp2016.mirage.io)**. This is powered by
the [Canopy](http://github.com/engil/Canopy) system built by Enguerrand
Decorne during his internship at OCaml Labs.
It uses much of the software pieces built for
[MirageOS](https://mirage.io), including
[Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin) to track the Git data and live
update the blog in response to pushes.

If you are at ICFP this week and would like to contribute to the
liveblog, your contributions would be most welcome! Just send in a pull
request to the Git repository at
[github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog](https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog)
or get in touch with a member of OCL to give you direct write access
(e.g. ping @avsm on Twitter).

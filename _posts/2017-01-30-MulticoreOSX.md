The ongoing [Multicore OCaml](/doc/multicore.html) development tree has been making steady progress in January,
and now [compiles on MacOS X](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore/pull/103).  Thank you to [Yotam Barnoy](https://github.com/bluddy)
for his contribution here!

You can track the progress towards the first alpha release on the [GitHub Projects page](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-multicore/projects/1).

KC was invited to speak at the most recent [London Facebook Faculty
Summit](https://londonfacebookfacultysummit.splashthat.com/) alongside
other faculty guests, Facebook engineers and researchers to discuss
recent developments in ML and programming languages.

Lightning talks from guests and hosts kickstarted the day, followed by
scheduled talks including
<Media:Effective_Parallelism_with_Reagents.pdf> where KC presented the
latest progress in the OCaml Multicore project. Algebraic effects allow
cooperative concurrency whilst the Reagents library presents composable
lock-free synchronisation using a compare-and-swap method.

about the motivations behind the Reagents library, and the need for
fine-grained parallelism on multicore hardware

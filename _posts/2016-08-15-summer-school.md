This summer we hosted the first International Summer School for
Metaprogramming at [Robinson College](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/),
Cambridge. The event was a huge success and it would not have been
possible without the generous financial support from our industrial
parters: [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/projects/),
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/),
[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/uk/index.html) and [ OCaml
Labs](/wiki/Home "wikilink"). We were fortunate to have an overwhelming number
of people register interest, and we welcomed students and speakers from
12 different countries, all with varying expertise and experience in the
metaprogramming field. The goal of the school was to present recent
research and development in the relatively modest field and we hoped to
encourage discussion and collaboration amongst a diverse group of users
and researchers.

Robinson College provided the venue and accommodation, and the
purpose-built, well-provisioned [Crausaz
Wordsworth](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/conferences/meet/crausaz-wordsworth-building)
conference building ensured that the group was well catered for.
Students and speakers had access to the beautiful college gardens to
explore during their residential stay, and the days were packed with
presentations, demos and talks, with excited conversation continuing
into the evenings.

In order to balance the high-focus schedule with some downtime, we
punted along the meadows towards Grantchester, in hunt of the obligatory
cream tea. Almost everyone had a "punt" and a jolly mix of crashing,
3-point turns, laughter, debates about the most efficient method of
propulsion method and successful bridge jumping made for a fun afternoon
in the sun. [Darwin College](https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/) hosted us
for our evening banquet, where we were lucky to have the entire dining
room to ourselves, a chance for lovely walks across the islands, and a
local caricaturist on hand to draw the guests.

The school was a fantastic opportunity to gather specialists and
newcomers within this research field, and initial feedback has been very
positive, especially with regards to the relaxed and collaborative
atmosphere. We hope this will help to grow the metaprogramming
community, and we encourage others to host and organise similar events
in the future.

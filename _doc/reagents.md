Efficient concurrent programming libraries are essential for taking advantage of fine-grained parallelism on multicore hardware. Reagents are a composable, lock-free concurrency library for expressing fine-grained parallel programs on [Multicore OCaml]({% link _doc/multicore.md %}). Reagents offer a high-level DSL for experts to specify efficient concurrency libraries, but also allows the consumers of the libraries to extend them further without knowing the details of the underlying implementation.
